# Module 1 Kickstarting with Excel Written Analysis

## **Overview of Project**

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to extract insights from a dataset on a wide range of kickstarter campaigns. These campaigns were for everything from theater productions to food trucks. Each campaign included information such as campaign funding goal, amount pledged, the dates of the campaigns, and other pertinent information. Using the insights generated by this analysis, I aim to better understand the characteristics of successful (and unsuccessful) projects.

## **Analysis and Challenges**
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The goal of this project is to determine and exploit any clear trends that suggest a relationship between a theater project's eventual success/failure and the date which its associated kickstarter campaign was launched. 

**Figure 1**

**Figure 1** shows that May is the month in which the most successful kickstarter campaigns are launched. However what is also true is that May is the month in which the most failed kickstarter campaigns are launched. In fact the peaks and troughs of both trend lines mirror one another thoughout the year. Between January and February, there is an uptick in both the number of failed projects and the number of successful projects. This is followed by decline in March, upticks in April and May. In the summer months of May, June, and July there are more successful projects than failed projects, however the decline in successful projects is greater in magnitude than the decline in failed projects, which more closely resembles a plateau. Therefore relatively fewer projects are succesfful later in the summer compared to the proportion of successful projects that were launched in May. Fall leads to a decline in both the number of successful and failed projects, except for an uptick in October. The number of successful and failed projects reaches their toughs in December. However, because the number of projects that succeed (37)is very close to the number of projects that fail (35), this means that there is roughly a fifty percent chance your project will fail, even though in absolute terms, December is the month plagued with the fewest failed projects. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## **Results**

- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
A project is most likely to succeed if its kickstarter is launched in May. A project has roughly an equal chance of succeeding or failing if launched in December.
- **What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

- **What are some limitations of this dataset?**

- **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?*
